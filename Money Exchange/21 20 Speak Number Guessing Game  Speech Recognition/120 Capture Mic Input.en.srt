1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,100
OK so now going to start to work with the speech recognition API.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,920
So as you could see here in the docs the speech recognition interface of the web speech API is the controller

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,640
interface for the recognition service.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,630
This also handles a speech recognition event sent from the recognition service.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,500
So it shows all the different properties and methods and stuff and what we're going to be working with

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,670
is the start method.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,290
So this will start the recognition service and listen to any incoming audio.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,020
So it also send a pop up to the browser to ask if you want to get permission to listen to your mike.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,370
And then as far as events we're going to be listened for the results event.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,330
This is fired off when the speech recognition returns a result.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,690
So basically when you talk into the mike this will fire off and we can capture whatever said and then

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,380
what else.

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,220
We have the end event.

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,950
So this will be fired when the speech service has been disconnected.

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,390
And that's those are pretty much the main events and methods will be working with.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,110
So let's jump into our JavaScript file here and the first thing I'm going to do is bring in the dorm

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,800
elements which in this case is just one we just want the message element.

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,620
So it's used document Dodds get element by D and has an I.D. of message.

19
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,170
So this is basically the output of whatever we want to tell the user if they need to go higher or whatever

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,980
and I'll also say whatever they speak into the mike.

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,470
So we need a random number between 1 and 100.

22
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,300
So let's go ahead and create a variable called random NUM and set that to a function called get random

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,570
number and then we're going to create that function down here get random number and to do this we're

24
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:57,690
going to return let's return and to generate a random decimal we can use math thought random and then

25
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,940
we can just multiply that by one hundred and then we want to round that down.

26
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:09,500
So let's go ahead and wrap this in our javascript math dot floor method.

27
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:12,500
Now this will give us zero through ninety nine.

28
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,130
So we want it to be one through 100.

29
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,910
So we're just going to add one on to that.

30
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,280
All right.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:29,070
And then let's we'll do a console log up here of random num excuse me and then we'll just open up our

32
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:35,360
console you can see we get forty five to five ninety eight thirty to seventy 71.

33
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,760
So just keep generating a random number when the page loads and let's just keep this here so we can

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,430
see what the correct guess is.

35
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,340
So I'll just say it's the same number.

36
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,430
Cole and then we'll just put a you know.

37
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,360
So it just says no and then whatever the correct number is.

38
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,420
Now for the speech recognition we need to initialize a speech recognition object.

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,360
Now in some browsers you might need to use the Web Kit speech recognition.

40
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,670
Like I said this is still kind of an experimental technology.

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,850
It's actually go right here.

42
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:23,820
So I'm going to take window dot speech recognition and set that to window dot speech recognition or

43
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,220
in some cases it might be Web Kit speech recognition.

44
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,990
So I'll say window dot web kids speech recognition.

45
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,270
OK.

46
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:44,910
So whichever one is available to us now we need to initialize a variable with that with that object.

47
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,990
So we're gonna say let's.

48
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,650
Recognition.

49
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:58,460
So we're creating a new variable and we're going to initialize a new window dot speech recognition.

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:58,970
OK.

51
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,310
So this will give us an object to work with and the first thing we want to do is start.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,340
So it's a start.

53
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,860
Recognition and game.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,650
So the game is going to start as soon as it loads so we'll say recognition dot start.

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,840
So I showed you that method in the documentation and I'm gonna save this Hello OK.

56
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,600
So what happened is you can see that you can see the little microphone blink up top.

57
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,630
So it ran or it started.

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,880
It captured what I said into the mike and nothing else happens because we we haven't said anything to

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,970
happen yet.

60
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,730
So what we need to do now is listen for the result event.

61
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,040
OK.

62
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:48,250
So let's say speak result and we're going to take that recognition object and add an event listener

63
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,870
and we want to listen for an event called result.

64
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,920
And then once that happens we'll call a function called on speak.

65
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,320
OK.

66
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:06,770
So let's see this on speak we'll go and create right above the random number let's put a comment here.

67
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,390
Generate and number

68
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:27,430
so for this let's say capture or use or speak so function on speak.

69
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,420
And that's part of an event listener so we're going to pass in that event parameter and what we want

70
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,110
to do here.

71
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,560
Let's just console log what that event gives us hello.

72
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:46,610
So this is what it gives me after I start after it starts and we catch our result and then run this

73
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,590
function.

74
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,570
So this this contains a lot of stuff but what we want to target right here is the results.

75
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,830
Can you see inside results.

76
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,000
And it's really important to recognize the the structure of this because this is how we need how we're

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,550
gonna get what we actually said.

78
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,120
So in results is an array it's a speech recognition result array there's only one item.

79
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,620
So it's zero and then there's another array inside that called speech recognition alternative.

80
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,000
So that's another array.

81
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,270
And then there's a property called transcript and that's where our text is K or whatever we said in

82
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,740
this case.

83
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,130
Hello.

84
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:33,470
So to capture that let's go ahead and get rid of this and let's create a variable called message and

85
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:40,190
let's set that to to our event and then we want the results.

86
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,570
OK.

87
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,360
So we're going here then we want to go to arrays in both at the zero index.

88
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,540
So the first array helps.

89
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,710
And then the next array and then that array has a property called transcript.

90
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:00,790
OK so that should give us whatever it is we say so let's console log here.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,910
Message Hello and there we go.

92
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,130
So now we can capture what is said into the microphone.

93
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,920
So pretty easy to get that functionality down.

94
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,400
Now one thing you might notice is it didn't prompt me at all to use my microphone and that's because

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,630
I've already dealt with this app on this host.

96
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:30,310
You will get a prompt to two to allow your microphone to basically get the input to your mike.

97
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,600
OK.

98
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:39,880
So now what we want to do is call two functions here the first one is going to be right message and

99
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,690
what that's going to do is it's going to just write out what we speak and then we also want to do we

100
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,750
want to check the number which is the point of the game and we're going to pass our message into that.

101
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,090
And that's going to check to see if it's a valid number.

102
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,320
Check to see if it's in between this range and check to see if it matches the actual number.

103
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,640
All right.

104
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,460
So I'm going to comment these out right now and save because we're gonna do these in the next video.

105
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,070
OK.

106
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,100
So when next few will create these two functions and we'll go from there.
