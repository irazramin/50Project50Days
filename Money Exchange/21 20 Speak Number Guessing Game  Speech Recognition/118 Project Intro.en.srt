00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,380
Hey what's going on guys.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,790
Welcome to your next project.

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,680
So this is gonna be a number guessing game but instead of typing in a number we're actually going to

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,100
speak it and we're gonna use the speech recognition API.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,840
Now the reason you see this on my screen.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,780
Congrats you've guessed the numbers because as soon as I start talking IT'S GOING TO RECORD.

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,400
RECORD MY VOICE I've already clicked a little notification where you can allow it to access your microphone.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,990
OK so basically we can guess a number between 1 and 100.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:33,870
If it's lower than the number it'll tell us to go higher if we're higher it'll tell us to go lower.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,450
And if it's not a number it'll tell us that it's not a valid number.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,530
It'll also tell us if we're out of range.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,490
So what I'm gonna do is click the play again button and then I'd give you a demo of the app and then

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,260
the console you can see the correct number down here.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,080
So let's click Play Again 40

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:54,380

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,500

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,790
Hello

18
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,830
47.

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,580
And there you go.

20
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,950
So we guess the number.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,220
OK.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,640
So that's the project that we'll be building.

23
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:15,870
And again we'll be using the speech recognition API which still is in experimental mode.

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,010
In fact if you're using you want to use Chrome or Firefox and if you're using firefox you may have to

25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:27,250
set a flag which I'll show you in the next video and then we'll start on the team Alan CSX and then

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,840
we'll move to the javascript.
