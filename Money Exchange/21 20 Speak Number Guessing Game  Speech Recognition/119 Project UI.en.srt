1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,320
All right so we're going to start on our speak no guesser app.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,090
Now this speech recognition API that we're using is it's an experimental technology.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,170
So it's not widely supported it's fully supported in Chrome.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,790
If you're on Firefox there is a flag that you'll have to enable.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,920
So I'm just going to show you how to do that real quick.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,230
So I'm just going to open up my Firefox browser and in the bra.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,590
And there you are Albar here.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm just going to say about Colon config and then accept the risk and continue it's just it just allows

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,670
us to change flags in the browser and we're going to search for a speech recognition or just speech

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,900
and let's see.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,860
We want to set this right here.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,340
MEDIA WEB speech recognition force enable you want to set that to true.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,300
You can see mind's already set to true.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,980
Yours will probably be set to false.

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,120
So you just want to click this right here and that will toggle from false to true.

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,720
So you want to make sure that that and this one here this recognition enable is true as well in order

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,200
for this to work and in order to basically be able to use your microphone in the application.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,430
All right.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,730
So let's jump into v as code and as far as my files I just have my main three my index SPY style sheet

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,780
my script and then I have two images in the I AMG folder ones the background image and one is the microphone

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,430
image to PMG.

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,560
OK so let's start off with the H team L which is gonna be really really simple.

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:41,060
So let's generate a boilerplate here and we'll say no or let's say speak no guests.

24
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,120
I mean I could call it something a little better but that's fine whatever.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:55,770
So let's add in our link to our style sheet style CSX and then let's add in our script source which

26
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,510
is going to be script J.S. and the each team is going to be really simple for us.

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:06,650
We're just going to have our image of the mike which is I am G slash Mike PMG.

28
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,370
I'll just say I don't know speak for the old and then underneath that we're gonna have our H one and

29
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:26,070
our each one is going to say guess a number between one and one hundred and then we're gonna have an

30
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:36,090
h three and just say speak number into your microphone.

31
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,230
And then the last thing we're gonna have is just a div with the I.D. of M.S. G for message and a class

32
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,490
of M.S. G.

33
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:51,120
Now ultimately this is gonna be empty because what is gonna be put in here is going to be generated

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,180
into the DOM through javascript it's gonna be like what we say and if we're correct and stuff like that.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,720
So for now I'm just going to hardcoded in so we'll put a div here and it's going to say you said coal

36
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,040
and then underneath that we'll have a span and I'm going to give this a class of box and it's gonna

37
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,970
have the number I'll just put a 20 in here for now and then underneath that it'll say like go lower

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,660
go higher or whatever.

39
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,980
So that's gonna be put into a div.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,410
Let's just say go higher.

41
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,630
So that's what it will look like.

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:36,320
So we'll save that and let's open this up in life server K and then I'm just going to make this smaller

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,520
that small if I can grab onto it all right.

44
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,820
So we have the H SYMBOL.

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,780
Now we're gonna add our style which is pretty simple.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:53,820
First thing we'll do is just set our box sizing on everything to border box.

47
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,260
And then for the body we'll set our background.

48
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:09,800
So I'm going to set a color in an image so the color will be hexadecimal to F 3 5 4 2 and then for the

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:16,850
image we're gonna say you are L and it's gonna be in the image folder and then be g dot J Peg let's

50
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:25,610
set a no repeat and let's set the positioning to left left center and we want to cover.

51
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,060
Okay.

52
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,930
And we wanted to take up the whole thing so let's say Men height on the body will be 100 viewport heights

53
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,230
and we'll add our color of white.

54
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,440
Let's just close that sidebar up and I want everything to be in the middle so I'm going to display flex

55
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,920
and also select set the Flex direction to column K and then to align everything to the middle we'll

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:00,570
do a line item center let's do justify content center and let's do text align center.

57
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,010
OK.

58
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:08,810
Some puts everything in the middle and then we'll add a margin zero and then just apply a font so let's

59
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,400
use we'll just use aerial here K to make this a little wider.

60
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,050
And if you want to add a media query to make the text smaller on really small screens you can do that

61
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,270
if you want but I've done that in enough projects it's it's pretty simple so I'm not going to bother

62
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,960
doing it here.

63
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,370
Let's let's fix the headings because these are kind of far apart here that the each one in the each

64
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:35,750
three.

65
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:46,220
So we'll just take the H one and h three and let's just set a margin bottom to zero looks like I put

66
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,450
two ends in no

67
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,270
OK.

68
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,900
Now there is gonna be part of this that we can't see right now.

69
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,390
Once we guessed the correct number we're gonna replace everything in the body with just a paragraph

70
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,340
that says you've guessed the correct number and it's gonna have a play again button.

71
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:15,080
So I'm just gonna add some style for the paragraph I'm just gonna change the line height to one point

72
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,820
five spread the line a little bit and then just set the margin to zero and then for the play button

73
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:31,280
so it'll have a class of play B T N or let's play again.

74
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:39,620
So this is just gonna have a padding of eight on the top and bottom in 15 on the sides and then I'm

75
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:49,070
gonna just remove the border set the background set the background to a light grey let's do f for three

76
00:06:49,070 --> 00:07:00,110
times and then just make it rounded radius 5 pixels and just set a margin top to bring it down a little

77
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,360
bit so we'll set that to 10 pixels.

78
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,620
OK now let's work on this this whole part right here which is the message.

79
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,140
So for the message itself I missed G class.

80
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,160
I'm going to set the font size.

81
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,820
We'll do one point five m and m unit is just it's relatable to its parent.

82
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,850
So it's going to be one point five times whatever the parent font is.

83
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,340
And then let's set a margin top to move it down and I'll set that to 40 pixels.

84
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,540
OK now for the box number the number has a box class.

85
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,620
So I want to have like a you know an outline or a border around that.

86
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:52,400
So let's say border and let's do one pixel solid and the color will be d e three times so really light

87
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,970
gray and I'm going to display it as an inline block because if you recall it's a span which is by default

88
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,930
it's in line.

89
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,250
And I want to be able to add margin padding so I'll set that to inline block.

90
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,930
I'm going to make the font size a little bigger so it's two 30 pixels.

91
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:16,060
And then let's set the margin to 20 pixels and we'll set the padding to 10 pixels.

92
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,780
OK so now I get that little box around it.

93
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,550
And that should be it for the for the styling.

94
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,790
All right.

95
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,970
So not too bad at all.

96
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:32,630
So what I want to do next can close these files up at least that we can get rid of the three lines in

97
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,790
here because like I said this is going to get added with the javascript so we can actually get rid of

98
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,250
that now.

99
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:40,660
OK.

100
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,820
So our UI is all set in the next video.

101
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:49,820
We're gonna go ahead and start to implement the speech recognition API generate a random number and

102
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,780
all that good stuff.
