1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,610
OK so now that we can grab the input from the microphone and we're putting it into this variable here

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,720
next thing we're gonna do is call a function called right message.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,020
So let's create that.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,330
So this is going to basically this is gonna tell.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,420
Well let's just say right.

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:26,870
What user speaks so function right message.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:34,170
It's going to take in the message and all we're really gonna do here is take the message element in

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,640
the DOM.

9
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:46,110
So message element and we're gonna add some H team L with enraged him out use some back tricks here

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,410
and it's gonna we're gonna put in the same stuff that we did manually and the aged him out earlier which

11
00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:02,820
is gonna be a div that says you said colon and then we're gonna have a span and that's going to have

12
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:13,550
a class of Bach's styling K and then in here we're gonna have the actual message.

13
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:23,440
So if I save this and I start to talk it's going to capture what I say and put it in there.

14
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:31,170
All right now that'll just basically put in what we say but we need to check our number.

15
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,420
Right.

16
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,760
We need to validate to make sure it's a number we need to check to see if it's in range and all that

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,090
stuff.

18
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,900
So that's going to go in this function here.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,850
So it's a check message against number.

20
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:54,760
So it's a function check number which we'll take in the message and first thing we'll do is create a

21
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,780
variable called NUM and set that to the message that's passed in but we want to convert it to a number.

22
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,080
OK.

23
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,930
So just adding a plus sign will convert it from a string to a number.

24
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,350
And then the first check I'm going to do is if it's a valid number

25
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,500
so say F now is a few ways to do this what I'm going to do is use the built in Number object in the.

26
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,720
Is Nan method here which stands for is not a number.

27
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:34,700
So if our number is not a number then let's take the message element and set the inner aged him out.

28
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,660
Now there's two things we could do here we could append it.

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:50,410
So plus equals and then our message which is going to be a div and we'll say that that is not a valid

30
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:50,790
number.

31
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,080
So we could append it.

32
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,210
And in this case what it's going to do is it'll stay it'll show what we say.

33
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,670
Just like it did here and then also say that is not a valid number and just keep going or we can just

34
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:10,600
set it to equals where it'll this will replace what we say so it won't actually it won't actually show

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,180
here unless it's a valid number and I think that's what I'm going to do.

36
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,820
But if you want to try it the other way after we're done you can go ahead and do that as well.

37
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,330
OK.

38
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,220
So then we just want to return.

39
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,040
So if I save hello that is not a valid number.

40
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,750
OK.

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,260
And then it kind of just stops there.

42
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,620
Now if I reload and I see a number 15 then it's going to go ahead and show.

43
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:38,950
OK.

44
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,350
So that will check for a valid number.

45
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,550
Now let's make sure it's in range

46
00:03:45,210 --> 00:04:00,180
so say if and let's say if the number is greater than 100 or the number is less than 1 then we're going

47
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:17,880
to take our message elements set the inner H temple to a div that says No must be between 1 and 100

48
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,110
OK.

49
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,600
So let's try that out.

50
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,950
We just want to return from this as well.

51
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,930

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,210
so there we go.

53
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,130
And actually this we're gonna spend because we want to keep playing and I'll show you how we'll do that

54
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,080
after basically when it ends after we say something and it ends we want to restart because we want to

55
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,010
be able to keep guessing but we're gonna do that after.

56
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,580
So now we want to check.

57
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,460
No.

58
00:04:52,150 --> 00:05:00,100
So we're going to first check to see if it matches so we'll say if the NUM is equal to the random num

59
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,020
then we won.

60
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,070
So all we're gonna do is just replace the body.

61
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:15,100
So I'm gonna say document dot body dot in our each team now and set that to some tactics and we'll put

62
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,540
it here in H2

63
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:28,090
and we'll say congrats you have guessed you've guessed the number.

64
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:38,380
And then we'll just put a couple line breaks here and then under that let's just say it was.

65
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,730
And then the number.

66
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,770
And then under the H two I'm just gonna have a play again button so I have button.

67
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,600
Give it a class of play again.

68
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,480
And an idea of play again.

69
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,960
And we'll add an event onto this and a little bit.

70
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,390
OK.

71
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,040
So that should happen if we win.

72
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,360
So down here let's do and.

73
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,090
Else if.

74
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:20,480
And now let's check to see if the number is greater than the random number.

75
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,440
OK.

76
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,060
So if it's greater then we need to send a message that says go lower right.

77
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,650
So we'll say.

78
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:32,080
Message element in our H team now and we'll set that to a div

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:45,580
and let's say go lower and then else so else then it's gonna be lower.

80
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,960
So we need to say go higher.

81
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,930
So it's a message element time in our AGM now.

82
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:59,380
And let's set that equal to a div and we'll just say go higher.

83
00:06:59,380 --> 00:06:59,680
All right.

84
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,330
Oh actually one thing we want to append this right here that go lower.

85
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:04,930
Go higher.

86
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:13,360
We want to do plus equals here because we just want to a pen because we still want to show up here where

87
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,190
it shows us what we said we still want to show that in addition to the go lower and go higher.

88
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,450
So this will append instead of replace.

89
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,760
So we're going to save this and reload and then I'll I'll speak in number 50.

90
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:34,670
OK so what it's doing now is it's it's working but it's only letting me guess once.

91
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:34,970
Right.

92
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,170
Because we start.

93
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,050
So we call start up here.

94
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,160
It listens.

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,730
And then when it gets a result it fires on speak and then we call in the on speak we call right masses

96
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,030
in check number and that's the end of the whole thing.

97
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,780
Right.

98
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,980
Well I want to be able to keep playing.

99
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,860
I want to be able to keep saying the number.

100
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,860
Some of the reload and because when we reload the number changes right.

101
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,070
So what we can do is add an event.

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,880
So there's a start.

103
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,390
And actually we want to look at the end event because the end event will fire off when it basically

104
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,020
we're done speaking.

105
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,350
So let's go down here and let's say and as AR service.

106
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:24,240
So when the speech recognition service ends say the event listener and we want to listen for and and

107
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,710
then when that happens I'm just gonna go ahead and in an arrow function I'm going to call recognition

108
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,850
dot start again.

109
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,970
Now I should be able to keep playing so I'm going to save 70

110
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,230

111
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,110

112
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,860

113
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,200
okay.

114
00:08:52,210 --> 00:09:00,490
So when I hit the right number this runs right here it changes the body the enraged him out to display

115
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,730
this.

116
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,250
All right.

117
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,080
So our game is working what we want to do now is just make this play button work because right now it

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,450
doesn't do anything.

119
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,950
So let's go down here and let's add an event.

120
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,890
So I'm gonna since this is generated after the DOM is already painted so weird because we're doing it

121
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,490
with our javascript we're going to add the event listener onto a parent.

122
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,890
So I'm going to add it onto the body.

123
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:37,660
So add add event listener onto the body and it's gonna be a click event and then we'll go ahead and

124
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,090
run a function and we want to make sure that that what we're clicking on is that button.

125
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:48,970
So I'll just have an if statement and we'll say if e dot target which means whatever the element we're

126
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,680
clicking on.

127
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:58,030
If that I.D. is equal to play again because that button has an idea of play again then we're just going

128
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,310
to reload the page and restart the game.

129
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:08,180
So on the window object we have a location object which has a method called reload.

130
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,730
OK.

131
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,310
So we can just call that 40

132
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,460

133
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,620
43 OK so we won.

134
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,560
I'm going to click this.

135
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,410
He is not the final two got to pass in here.

136
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,110
He had to try it again 44

137
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:42,350
and there we go so it just resets and it's going to tell me that it's not a no hep C not a valid number.

138
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,630
Now in this case the game stops.

139
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:54,110
So if I say like 15 it's not going to do anything because we've completely replaced it still listening.

140
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,480
You can see the mike up here.

141
00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:02,250
But we've completely replaced the the guess or is it.

142
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,410
So right here it says you said and then the number we replace that with.

143
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,060
This is not a valid number because we didn't pen so it might actually be a good idea edited to add a

144
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,320
plus sign here so that you can keep playing even if it's not a valid number.

145
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,390
So let's try that 15 Hello

146
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,250
25 20 OK.

147
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:36,910
So yeah that's probably a better idea because it's a little confusing if we just replace the message

148
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,390
element and then we can't we basically can't play anymore.

149
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,610
So I think that that's a you know that's the right way to do it.

150
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:44,880
All right.

151
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,370
So that's it.

152
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:51,040
Guys hopefully you learn something from this video and you can use the speech recognition API to kind

153
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,010
of you know build your own stuff using speech recognition.

154
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,780
I think that's going to be something that's going to gain more popularity as time goes on.

155
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:05,200
You know with all the A.I. stuff and Alexis and Google homes and all that stuff it's just I think it's

156
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,880
it's going to be really popular in the future but that's it that's going to be the last project for

157
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,360
now.

158
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,250
I do plan on adding more in the future but hopefully you've learned a lot from the projects that you've

159
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,900
done in this course already.

160
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,280
And I would highly encourage you to take what you've learned and start to build your own projects and

161
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,700
come up with ideas and even take the projects from this course and modify them make them better add

162
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,750
new functionality because just watching a course or a tutorial and copying the code that helps you learn.

163
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,580
But when you actually dive in and get your hands dirty and you start creating your own projects or adding
